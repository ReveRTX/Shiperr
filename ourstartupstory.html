				<p>Mahendra had been in the logistics field for six years, gathering experience from major companies
					like E-kart, Ecom Express, and Shadowfax. He started as a delivery partner and, over time, rose to a
					hub manager position, gaining deep insights into the industry. His journey, however, was far from
					easy, as he faced countless obstacles and witnessed firsthand the challenges delivery partners
					endure.</p>

				<p>Every day, Mahendra saw delivery partners—colleagues, friends, even himself at one point—laboring to
					deliver hundreds of packages, ensuring customers received their orders on time. It was a job that
					required endurance, skill, and resilience. Yet, despite the value they brought to the companies,
					delivery partners often received low wages and were met with disrespect, sometimes even inhumane
					treatment. They navigated traffic, dealt with hostile customers, and juggled the pressure of tight
					deadlines, all while carrying the weight of packages, day in and day out. Mahendra also noticed that
					delivery partners received payouts only once a week, which wasn’t ideal. In emergencies, they could
					withdraw up to 50% from their wallet, but with an extra fee charged by the company. This policy made
					it
					even harder for partners to manage their finances during unexpected situations.</p>

				<p>But what hurt Mahendra most was the lack of appreciation and acknowledgment. He knew that without
					these delivery partners, customers wouldn’t receive their packages, and the companies wouldn’t run
					smoothly. Yet, they remained invisible, often dismissed as mere "delivery people," rather than
					valued contributors to the supply chain.</p>

				<p>Meanwhile, Harsha, a frequent user of travel and logistics apps, noticed a different kind of
					problem. Every platform he used charged high commissions—anywhere from 10% to 20%—from drivers and
					delivery partners. During his trips, he often struck up conversations with drivers, asking questions
					like, “Do you get paid enough?” and “How much of your earnings go to the app?”</p>

				<p>Harsha’s experience with a furniture move confirmed his suspicions. He’d booked a mini truck, but
					the one that arrived wasn’t the same as advertised, and by the end of the trip, the driver requested
					extra payment to cover the commission deducted by the app. Since the driver only received his
					earnings weekly, he explained to Harsha that he needed immediate funds to cover his expenses and
					requested a direct payment to his bank account through UPI. This sparked
					Harsha’s curiosity, leading him to start researching logistics apps and how much they deducted from
					delivery partners’ earnings.</p>

				<p>The two shared their observations with each other, and they realized they both had a common goal:
					to create a platform that respected delivery partners and provided fair earnings with minimal
					commissions. Together, Mahendra and Harsha came up with Shiperr—a logistics and on-demand delivery
					app with a mission to ensure good earnings with zero or low commissions for delivery partners.
					Shiperr was not just a business idea; it was a commitment to honor those who kept the logistics
					industry running.</p>

				<p>Shiperr aimed to break the cycle, providing a platform where delivery partners could thrive without
					unfair deductions and customers could trust they were supporting a fair system. Mahendra and
					Harsha’s shared vision turned into Shiperr—a new way forward in on-demand delivery & logistics.</p>
